NAME
       strtrim - Trim specified characters from the beginning and end of a string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       char *strtrim(char const *s1, char const *set);

DESCRIPTION
       The strtrim() function allocates and returns a new string that is a copy of 's1' with leading and trailing characters specified in 'set' removed. The memory for the new string is allocated using malloc(3).

PARAMETERS
       s1: The string to be trimmed.
       set: The reference set of characters to trim.

RETURN VALUE
       The trimmed string.
       NULL if the allocation fails.

EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS
       malloc(3) - allocate dynamic memory

NOTES
       The caller is responsible for freeing the allocated memory using free(3) when it is no longer needed.

EXAMPLES
       char *trimmed_str = strtrim("   Hello, World!   ", " ");
       // trimmed_str is now "Hello, World!"

SEE ALSO
       malloc(3), free(3)
