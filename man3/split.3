NAME
       split - Split a string into an array of strings using a specified delimiter

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       char **split(char const *s, char c);

DESCRIPTION
       The split() function allocates and returns an array of strings obtained by splitting the input string 's' using the character 'c' as a delimiter. The memory for the array and individual strings is allocated using malloc(3).

PARAMETERS
       s: The string to be split.
       c: The delimiter character.

RETURN VALUE
       The array of new strings resulting from the split.
       NULL if the allocation fails.

EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS
       malloc(3) - allocate dynamic memory
       free(3) - deallocate memory

NOTES
       The array of strings must end with a NULL pointer.

       The caller is responsible for freeing the allocated memory using free(3) when it is no longer needed.

EXAMPLES
       char **result_array = split("Hello, World!", ',');
       // result_array is {"Hello", " World!"}

SEE ALSO
       malloc(3), free(3)
