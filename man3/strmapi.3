NAME
       strmapi - Apply a function to each character of a string and create a new string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       char *strmapi(char const *s, char (*f)(unsigned int, char));

DESCRIPTION
       The strmapi() function applies the function 'f' to each character of the string 's', passing its index as the first argument. It creates and returns a new string resulting from successive applications of 'f'. The memory for the new string is allocated using malloc(3).

PARAMETERS
       s: The string on which to iterate.
       f: The function to apply to each character.

RETURN VALUE
       The string created from the successive applications of 'f'.
       NULL if the allocation fails.

EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS
       malloc(3) - allocate dynamic memory

NOTES
       The caller is responsible for freeing the allocated memory using free(3) when it is no longer needed.

EXAMPLES
       char *result_str = strmapi("Hello", my_function);
       // Assuming my_function is a custom function that appends the character index to each character.
       // If my_function(index, 'H') returns 'H0', my_function(index, 'e') returns 'e1', and so on,
       // then result_str would be "H0e1l2l3o4".

SEE ALSO
