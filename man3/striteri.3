NAME
       striteri - Apply a function to each character of a string, passing its index as the first argument

SYNOPSIS
       void striteri(char *s, void (*f)(unsigned int, char*));

DESCRIPTION
       The striteri() function applies the function 'f' to each character of the string 's', passing its index as the first argument. Each character is passed by address to 'f' to be modified if necessary.

PARAMETERS
       s: The string on which to iterate.
       f: The function to apply to each character.

RETURN VALUE
       None

EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS
       None

NOTES
       This function modifies the characters in-place. It does not allocate new memory for the string.

EXAMPLES
       void my_function(unsigned int index, char *c) {
           // Example function that appends the character index to each character.
           *c = *c + index;
       }

       char str[] = "Hello";
       striteri(str, my_function);
       // After the function call, str would be "H1e2l3l4o5".
